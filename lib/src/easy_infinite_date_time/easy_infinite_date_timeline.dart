class EasyInfiniteDateTimeLine extends StatefulWidget {
  /// A widget that displays an infinite date timeline.
  ///
  /// The timeline widget allows users to scroll through a range of dates and select a specific date.
  /// It provides a visual representation of the dates, with each day displayed as a separate widget.
  /// The timeline can be customized with various properties to control its appearance and behavior.
  ///
  /// The [EasyInfiniteDateTimeLine] widget requires the following parameters:
  /// - [firstDate]: Represents the initial date for the timeline widget.
  /// - [focusDate]: Represents the focus date for the timeline widget.
  /// - [lastDate]: Represents the last date for the timeline widget.
  ///
  /// Optional parameters include:
  /// - [disabledDates]: Represents a list of inactive dates for the timeline widget.
  /// - [activeColor]: The color for the active day.
  /// - [timeLineProps]: Contains properties for configuring the appearance and behavior of the timeline widget.
  /// - [dayProps]: Contains properties for configuring the appearance and behavior of the day widgets in the timeline.
  /// - [onDateChange]: Called when the selected date in the timeline changes.
  /// - [itemBuilder]: A callback function that builds the custom day widgets for the timeline.
  /// - [locale]: A `String` that represents the locale code to use for formatting the dates in the timeline.
  /// - [controller]: The controller to manage the EasyInfiniteDateTimeline.
  /// - [showTimelineHeader]: Represents whether the timeline header should be displayed or not.
  /// - [headerBuilder]: The callback function used to build the header of the infinite date timeline.
  /// - [autoCenter]: Automatically centers the selected day in the timeline.
  ///
  /// Example usage:
  /// ```dart
  /// EasyInfiniteDateTimeLine(
  ///   firstDate: DateTime(2022, 1, 1),
  ///   focusDate: DateTime(2022, 1, 15),
  ///   lastDate: DateTime(2022, 12, 31),
